## What's Happening Here?

[MUSE](https://url-muse.firebaseapp.com/) is a small, phishing-aware, single-page url-shortening app.
It uses a React/redux/node.js stack built on the Firebase database and cloud function hosting.

If you click on [MUSE](https://url-muse.firebaseapp.com/), it will take you to a Firebase hosted deployment
of the app, where you can submit a url and receive a (...relatively) shortened link in return.

The app also uses phishtank's API to check to see if the link you are trying to shorten is a common phishing
scam link, and won't let you use the service to do such terrible, terrible things.

After verification, you'll receive your new link as well as some handy formats to copy straight to your clipboard.

Enjoy!
